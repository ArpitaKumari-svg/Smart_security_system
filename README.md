# Smart_security_system
This project is a smart security system built using an ESP8266 (NodeMCU) microcontroller, an IR motion sensor, an LDR for darkness detection, a buzzer, an LED, and a 7-segment display. The system is activated only in dark environments, and triggers an alert when motion is detected.
